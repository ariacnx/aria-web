# Clean Eats product demo images

Put your app screenshots here. They’ll show on the EAT Recipe App product page.

**Filenames:**
- **Hero** (big “See it in action” image): any file with `hero` in the name, e.g. `hero.jpg`, `hero-image.png`
- **How it works** (3 smaller images): any other `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.webp` — used in filename order (first 3)

If the folder is empty, the page falls back to placeholder images.
